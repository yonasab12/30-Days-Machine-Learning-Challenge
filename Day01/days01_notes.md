Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with
pandas: Unveiling the Secrets Within Your
Data
Congratulations! You've conquered the challenges of data cleaning and
manipulation. Now, it's time to unleash the power of exploratory data
analysis (EDA) with pandas. This is where you transform your prepared
data into a treasure trove of insights, setting the stage for building powerful
machine learning models.
What is EDA?
Think of EDA as a detective's work. You'll use various techniques to
investigate, analyse, and visualise your data, uncovering hidden patterns,
relationships, and trends. This information is crucial for:
● Understanding your data: Gain insights into the central tendencies,
distributions, and potential biases within your data.
● Formulating hypotheses: Based on your findings, you can develop
educated guesses about the relationships between variables, which
can guide your machine learning modelling choices
Essential EDA Techniques with pandas:
● Summary statistics: Use the describe() method to
get a quick overview of central tendency
(mean, median) and spread (standard
deviation) for numerical features.
