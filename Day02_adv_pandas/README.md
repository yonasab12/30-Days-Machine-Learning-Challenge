In Pandas, .loc and .iloc are two of the primary methods for selecting and accessing data in a DataFrame or Series. They differ in how they index and retrieve data.

1. .loc (Label-Based Indexing)
What it Does: .loc is used to select data based on the labels (names) of rows and columns.

Key Features:

Uses explicit labels for indexing.
Includes the end of the range in slicing.
Supports boolean indexing and conditional filtering.


2.iloc (Integer-Based Indexing)
What it Does: .iloc is used to select data based on the integer position of rows and columns.

Key Features:

Uses integer-based positions for indexing.
Excludes the end of the range in slicing.
Does not rely on labels.
