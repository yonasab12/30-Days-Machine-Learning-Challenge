Greetings, data enthusiasts! Buckle up, because we're about to embark on a
thrilling journey into the realm of linear regression! Ever wondered how to
predict continuous values like house prices, stock prices, or customer wait
times based on other factors? Look no further, for linear regression is your
trusty compass in this fascinating world!
Salutations, fan of data! Fasten your seatbelts, because we are going to
delve into the intriguing realm of linear regression. This method aids in the
prediction of continuous values by examining their correlation with other
features.
Think of it this way: You're a data scientist working for a ride-sharing
company. You have a massive dataset containing information on rides,
including the distance travelled and the corresponding fare paid. You're
curious: can you predict the fare for a new ride based on its distance?
This is where linear regression comes in! It's like a detective, searching for
the best-fitting straight line that minimises the difference between the actual
fare values and the line's predictions. This line represents the linear
