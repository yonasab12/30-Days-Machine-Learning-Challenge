Classification Pipeline with GridSearchCV
This project demonstrates the implementation of a machine learning classification pipeline using scikit-learn. The pipeline includes preprocessing steps, a Random Forest Classifier, and hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.

Features
Pipeline Setup: Combines preprocessing and model training into a single pipeline for clean and maintainable code.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilizes GridSearchCV to find the optimal model parameters.
Cross-Validation: Employs K-Fold cross-validation to ensure reliable performance evaluation
